# Designing a Resource Policy 

Use the procedures described in this section to design a resource policy. These procedures are general in nature and cover the most common policy definitions. Create and apply additional policies as new requirements arise
 

Collect policy information as shown in the following tables: 

   ### Policy/Initiative definition
 
   | __Field__ | __Value__ |

   | [Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-policy/policy-definition#mode)    | all, indexed |  
   | [Policy Parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-policy/policy-definition#parameters)   |  |  
   | [Policy Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/azure-policy/policy-definition#policy-rule)   |  |  
   | Effect |Audit, Deny, Append, AuditIfNotExists, DeployIfNotExists, DenyIfNotExists|
    
   *In the case of initiatives 


   ### Policy/Initiative assignment 
   
   | __Field__ | __Value__ |
   |------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Name    | assignment name   | 
   | Policy Definition     | policy definition> (see above)  | 
   | Scope   | subscription, resource group, resource  | 
   | Exclude Scope    |  |  


## Procedure: How to create and assign a resource policy
