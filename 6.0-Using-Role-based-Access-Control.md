# Using Role-based Access Control (RBAC) 


Use this section as general guidance when planning and designing how to deploy the implementation of your Azure Roles. This 
information is useful if you are new to Azure and need guidance and a quick method on how to start assigning Azure roles. 


 


Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables fine-grained access management for Azure. Using RBAC, you can grant only the 
amount of access that users need to perform their jobs.  


 


Top 10 Built-In Azure Roles 


Use the information in the table below as a guideline when choosing roles. The table contains the top 10 Azure Built-in 
roles which you can use to begin defining your roles. 


 







Role 
 


Responsibility 
 


Scope  


(Subscription, Resource Group, Azure Resource) 
 


Role Owner 
 



Subscription Owner* 
 


Can manage everything, including access 


 
 


Subscription 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Subscription Contributor 
 


Can manage everything except access 
 


Subscription 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Subscription Reader 
 


Can view everything, but can't make changes 
 


Subscription 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Resource Group Owner 
 


Can manage everything, including access 
 


Resource Group 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Resource Group Contributor 
 


Can manage everything except access 
 


Resource Group 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Resource Group Reader 
 


Can view everything, but can't make changes 
 


Resource Group 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Security Admin 
 


Can manage everything, including access 
 


Subscription 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Security Manager 
 


Can manage everything except access 
 


Subscription 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Security Reader  
 


Can view everything, but can't make changes 
 


Subscription 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 



Billing Reader 
 


Makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health. 
 


Subscription or Tenant 
 


<enter azure ad account> 
 


 


*The first person to create the subscription is the subscription administrator and becomes the default subscription owner.

Next Steps 


Assign users or groups to built-in Azure roles, see:  Viewing or Modifying RBAC Role Assignments. 


 


 


 


Additional information 


Consider the following supplemental information: 


 


Advantages: 

No need to create custom roles 


Easy foundational start to azure roles 



 


Disadvantages: 

Difficult to match on-premise permissions to cloud 


Work to be done later on to assign additional roles as an organization evolves to adopt Azure 



 


Design considerations: 

Azure Roles, when applied at subscription level, are inherited into resource groups and corresponding resources. 


The scope of where you assign azure roles is at the subscription, resource group or resource level 


Azure Role permissions can be assigned to user groups or applications 


Azure has 65 built-in roles (as of Dec. 15, 2017) 


You cannot modify the definitions of built-in roles. You can however, create custom roles in Azure RBAC to fit the specific needs 
of your organization. 


Any significant change to resources or infrastructure involves multiple rolesâ€”that is, more than one person must review and 
approve a change. This separation of responsibilities limits the ability of a single person to access sensitive data or introduce 
vulnerabilities without the knowledge of other team members. 



 


Proven practices: 

Start with top 10 most common roles and avoid complexity. Complexity is usually a result of defining too many roles. 



 

Connect your corporate identity store (most commonly Active Directory) to Azure Active Directory using the AD Connect tool. 



 

Control the Admin/Co-Admin of a subscription using a managed identity. Don't assign Admin/Co-admin to a new subscription 
owner. Instead, use RBAC roles to provide owner rights to a group or individual. 



 

Add Azure users to a group (for example, Application X Owners) in Active Directory. Use the synchronized group to provide 
group members with the appropriate rights to manage the resource group containing the application. 



 

Follow the principle of granting the least privilege required to do the expected work.  



Example:  

Deployment Group: A group that is only able to deploy resources. 


Virtual Machine Management: A group that is able to restart VMs (for operations) 



 

Use Azure Active Directory for Azure Governance roles. 



 

Use Built-In Roles before Custom Roles. 



There are two primary reasons why these Custom Roles should be used: 


1. There is no existing built-in role to provide the role needed. 


2. An existing built-in role may exist, but gives away too many rights, and there is a need to reduce the rights to just the 
bare minimum 


. 

Create custom RBAC roles only if built-in roles do not exist 



 

Use groups to assign RBAC versus users 



 

Leverage Azure PIM to govern lifecycle of Azure roles. 



 

Start small with key foundational roles and add roles as needed 



 

Use the JEA (just enough administration) and JIT (just in time) role philosophies 



 

Avoid assigning permanent roles 



 

Set up alerts for role changes (see Top 10 Realtime Alerts for Azure Subscriptions).
