# Using Role-based Access Control (RBAC) 


Use this section as general guidance when planning and designing how to deploy the implementation of your Azure Roles. This 
information is useful if you are new to Azure and need guidance and a quick method on how to start assigning Azure roles. 


Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables fine-grained access management for Azure. Using RBAC, you can grant only the 
amount of access that users need to perform their jobs.  

**Advantages:** 

  - No need to create custom roles 
  - Easy foundational start to azure roles 

**Disadvantages:** 

  - Difficult to match on-premise permissions to cloud 
  - Work to be done later on to assign additional roles as an organization evolves to adopt Azure 
 


## Top 10 Built-In Azure Roles 


Use the information in the table below as a guideline when choosing roles. The table contains the top 10 Azure Built-in 
roles which you can use to begin defining your roles. 

   | __Role__ | __Responsibility__ |__Scope__ |__Role Owner__ |
   |------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Subscription Owner*   | Can manage everything, including access    | Subscription   | enter azure ad account   | 
   | Subscription Contributor    | Can manage everything except access  |  Subscription    | enter azure ad account   | 
   | Subscription Reader | Can view everything, but can't make changes   |  Subscription  | enter azure ad account   | 
   | Resource Group Owner    | Can manage everything, including access   |  Resource Group   | enter azure ad account  | 
   | Resource Group Contributor  | Can manage everything except access |  Resource Group   | enter azure ad account   | 
   | Resource Group Reader    | Can view everything, but can't make changes  |  Resource Group  | enter azure ad account   | 
   | Security Admin    | Can manage everything, including access  | Subscription  |  enter azure ad account   |  
   | Security Manager   | Can manage everything except access  |  Subscription   | enter azure ad account   | 
   | Security Reader   | Can view everything, but can't make changes  |  Subscription   | enter azure ad account   | 
   | Billing Reader   | Makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health.  |  Subscription or Tenant  | enter azure ad account | 

 
*The first person to create the subscription is the subscription administrator and becomes the default subscription owner.

## Guidance


- Start with top 10 most common roles and avoid complexity. Complexity is usually a result of defining too many roles. 
- Connect your corporate identity store (most commonly Active Directory) to Azure Active Directory using the AD Connect tool. 
- Control the Admin/Co-Admin of a subscription using a managed identity. Don't assign Admin/Co-admin to a new subscription 
owner. Instead, use RBAC roles to provide owner rights to a group or individual. 
- Add Azure users to a group (for example, Application X Owners) in Active Directory. Use the synchronized group to provide 
group members with the appropriate rights to manage the resource group containing the application. 
- Follow the principle of granting the least privilege required to do the expected work. For Example"
   - Deployment Group: A group that is only able to deploy resources. 
   - Virtual Machine Management: A group that is able to restart VMs (for operations) 
- Use Azure Active Directory for Azure Governance roles. 
- Use Built-In Roles before Custom Roles. There are two primary reasons why these Custom Roles should be used: 
   1. There is no existing built-in role to provide the role needed. 
   2. An existing [built-in role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) may exist, but gives away too many rights, and there is a need to reduce the rights to just the 
bare minimum 
- [Create custom RBAC roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) only if built-in roles do not exist 
- Use groups to assign RBAC versus users 
- Leverage [Azure PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-how-to-add-role-to-user?toc=%2fazure%2factive-directory%2fprivileged-identity-management%2ftoc.json)to govern lifecycle of Azure roles. 
- Start small with key foundational roles and add roles as needed 
- Use the JEA (just enough administration) and [JIT (just in time)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-just-in-time#using-just-in-time-access) role philosophies 
- Avoid assigning permanent roles 
- Set up alerts for role changes (see Top 10 Realtime Alerts for Azure Subscriptions).
