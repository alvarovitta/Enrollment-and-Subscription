# Defining Resource Policies and Locks


An Azure Resource Manager Policy is a service available in Azure to create, assign and, manage policy definitions. Policy 
definitions enforce different rules and actions over the resources to ensure they comply with organizational standards 
and service level agreements (SLAs). 

Resource locks provide the ability for organizations to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource. A lock prevents 
other roles in the organization from inadvertently deleting or modifying critical resources. Resource locks allow you to 
prevent unwanted or accidental changes or deletion to a resource.  

Before using resource locks, establish proper planning for objects and operational processes for creating and removing 
locks. Use resource locks for objects that  are mostly static from a configuration perspective.  


 
## Guidance
Consider the following supplemental guidance to help you define your resource policies:  

   - Keep organizational hierarchies in mind when creating definitions and assignments.  
   - Create policy definitions at a higher level such as the management group or subscription level, 
   and assigning at the next child level. For example, if you create a policy definition at the management group level, a policy assignment of that definition can be scoped down to a subscription level within that management group.  
   - To apply policies across subscriptions, you must have permissions across the subscriptions. 
   - Plan how to manage policy exceptions 
   - Start with using an audit effect vs a deny effect when creating policy definitions in your environment. This 
   technique will help you track the effects of your policy definition on the resources in your environment. For example, if you have scripts already in place to autoscale up your applications, setting a deny effect may hinder those automation tasks you already have in place.   
   - Use initiative definitions instead of policy definitions even for single policies. This technique helps with tracking. For example, policy definition (policyDefA) was created under the initiative definition (initiativeDefC). If you later decide 
   to create another policy definition for policyDefB with goals similar to that of policyDefA, you can add it 
   under initiativeDefC.  
   - Apply policies that map to organizational compliance, operational and security requirements. 
   - Develop a process that justifies and manages exceptions to policies.
