# Using the Agile IT Workloads Pattern 



resource groups reflect the layers of deployment in the workload (web, app, data, management tiers).   


 


If an application is composed of a set of web servers, app servers and, database servers you can identify the corresponding resource groups 
needed for that application as: web, app, and database resource groups.
