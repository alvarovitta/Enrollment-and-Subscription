# Using the Agile IT Workloads Pattern 


Use the procedure in this section to create a resource group design pattern that matches the lifecycle of your Agile IT workload layers. The  resource groups reflect the layers of deployment in the workload (web, app, data, management tiers).   

If an application is composed of a set of web servers, app servers and, database servers you can identify the corresponding resource groups needed for that application as: web, app, and database resource groups. 


**Advantages:** 

IT workload components are grouped base on the function they provide to that workload 


**Disadvantages:**

Additional management overhead in having to administer several: 
   - Network security groups (NSGs) 
   - RBAC 
   - Resource policies 


## Procedure: How to create an Agile IT workloads patternâ€¯ 


**1. Define the Resource Group model** 
   - Review the guidance and patterns provided in this section. 

**2. Create and Manage Resource Groups** 
   - Refer to:  [Manage Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/resourcegroups) through portal. 

**3. Create Azure Resource Group** 
   - Use the: New-AzureRmResourceGroup commandlet. See:   [Azure Resource groups using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup?view=azurermps-6.1.0&viewFallbackFrom=azurermps-5.1.1) 
   - **For Example**: Create two resource groups across two different regions in same subscription 
      - PS> Select-AzureRmSubscription -Subscription $ProductionSubscription 
        New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $WebTier -Location CanadaEast 
        New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $DatabaseTier -Location CanadaCentral
