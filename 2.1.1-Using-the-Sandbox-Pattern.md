# Using the Sandbox Pattern 
Use the Sandbox Pattern when learning to use Azure.  
<br />
<br />

**The Sandbox scenario is designed**:   
- to provide an environment for learning and experimentation for non-production workloads  

- to provide an isolated network environment  
- to support easy build-up and tear-down of infrastructure resources  
- as a single, trust-worthy Azure AD tenant  
- for use with a single sandbox account owner assigned  
<br />
<br />

The following table provides a profile description for the personas who use this pattern:  

| Persona | Requirement|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|IT Operations | Need a sandbox environment to easily and quickly provision resources for non-production workloads|
|Security/Compliance Officer | Need to segregate access controls from production workloads |
|Finance/Business | Need to leverage discounted subscription for sandbox environments |
|Development Manager | Need a self-service environment to experiment with azure features/functionality that can be easily be setup and torn down |
<br /> 
<br />

## Additional information  
Consider the following supplemental information for this pattern:  

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ------ | -------- |
|vNet address spaces can be tailored per application without risk of network address space conflicts  | Granulated Application RBAC model  |
|Lower cost on Dev Test Subscriptions  | Requires little to no capacity planning  |
|Minimal risk of affecting production workloads  | No access to corporate services  |
