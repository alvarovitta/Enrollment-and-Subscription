# Applying Resource Lock Policies 
Use the procedure described in this section to apply a resource lock. 
<br />
<br />

Azure Resource Manager provides the ability to restrict operations on resources through resource management locks. Locks are policies which enforce a lock level at a particular scope (subscription, resource group or resource).  

The lock level identifies the type of enforcement for the policy. The lock level has two values: 

1. **CanNotDelete**: Authorized users can still read and modify resources, but they can't delete any of the restricted resources.  
2. **ReadOnly**: Authorized users can only read from the resource, but they can't modify or delete any of the restricted resources 
<br />
<br />

## Preparation 
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  

1. Consult the following stakeholders as part of the subscription definition:

   a. **Workload service owners**:  Owner of the business requirements and driver of consumption of the 
   different cloud services. 

   b. **Fabric administrator**:  [to be defined, replaced, or removed] 

   c. **IT Operations Owners**:  Owner of the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service 
   Management and continuity of operations. 

   d. **IT Security and Compliance**:  Owner of the customer policies and procedures related to information 
   classification and handling, security monitoring and controls, and security incident management. 


2. Collect the subscriber details as outlined in the following table:


   | __Field__ | __Value__ |
   |------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Lock  |   | 
   | Scope    | \<Subscription\>, \<Resource Group\>, \<Azure Resource\>| 
   | Enforcement  | \<CanNotDelete\>, \<ReadOnly\>  | 
<br />
<br />

## Procedure:  How to apply resource locks 
Use this procedure to apply a resource lock. Locks can be applied using ARM templates, ARM REST API, or ARM Azure PowerShell.  

Access to Microsoft.Authorization/* or Microsoft.Authorization/locks/* actions is required to create or delete management locks. Only the Owner and user access Administrator can access the built-in roles. 

Refer to [Using Baseline Resource Policies](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/5.1.1-Top-10-Azure-Baseline-Security-Policies.md) for recommended patterns. 


1. **Open the Account Portal**   
  Sign-in to the [Account Portal](https://account.azure.com) as the Subscription Owner.  

2. **Create Locks - Portal**  
  [Lock the resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources) to prevent unexpected changes. 

3. **Create Locks - PowerShell**  
  [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcelock?view=azurermps-6.1.0&viewFallbackFrom=azurermps-5.1.1#examples)
