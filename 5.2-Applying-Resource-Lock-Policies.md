# Applying Resource Lock Policies 


Use the procedure described in this section to apply a resource lock. 


 


Azure Resource Manager provides the ability to restrict operations on resources through resource management locks. Locks are policies which 
enforce a lock level at a particular scope (subscription, resource group or resource).  


 


The lock level identifies the type of enforcement for the policy, which has two values: 

CanNotDelete: authorized users can still read and modify resources, but they can't delete any of the restricted resources.  


ReadOnly: authorized users can only read from the resource, but they can't modify or delete any of the restricted resources 



 


 


Preparation 


Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  


 

Consult with the following stakeholders to define the requirements: 



 

Department Owners:  Responsible and accountable for the consumption of Azure services and related expenses 



 

Workload service owners: Owner of the business requirements and driver of consumption of the different cloud services. 



 

Fabric administrator: [to be defined, replaced, or removed] 



 

IT Operations Owners: As owner of the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service Management and continuity of 
operations.

security monitoring and controls, and security incident management.
