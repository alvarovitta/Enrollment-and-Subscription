# Applying Resource Lock Policies 


Use the procedure described in this section to apply a resource lock. 



Azure Resource Manager provides the ability to restrict operations on resources through resource management locks. Locks are policies which enforce a lock level at a particular scope (subscription, resource group or resource).  


The lock level identifies the type of enforcement for the policy, which has two values: 

- **CanNotDelete**: authorized users can still read and modify resources, but they can't delete any of the restricted resources.  
- **ReadOnly**: authorized users can only read from the resource, but they can't modify or delete any of the restricted resources 


## Preparation 


Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  


**1. Consult the following stakeholders as part of the subscription definition:**

   - **Workload service owners**:  Owner of the business requirements and driver of consumption of the 
   different cloud services. 

   - **Fabric administrator**:  [to be defined, replaced, or removed] 

   - **IT Operations Owners**:  Owner of the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service 
   Management and continuity of operations. 

   - **IT Security and Compliance**:  Owner of the customer policies and procedures related to information 
   classification and handling, security monitoring and controls, and security incident management. 


**2. Collect the subscriber details as outlined in the following table:**


   | __Field__ | __Value__ |
   |------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Lock  |   | 
   | Scope    | Subscription, Resource Group, Azure Resource| 
   | Enforcement  | CanNotDelete, ReadOnly  | 
 

## Procedure:  How to apply resource locks 


 
Use this procedure to apply a resource lock. Locks can be applied using ARM templates, ARM REST API, or ARM Azure PowerShell.  

To create or delete management locks access to Microsoft.Authorization/* or Microsoft.Authorization/locks/* actions is required. 

Only the Owner and User Access Administrator can access the built-in roles. 


Refer to [Using Baseline Resource Policies](http)s://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/5.1.1-Top-10-Azure-Baseline-Security-Policies.md) for recommended patterns. 


**1. Open the Account Portal**  
  - Sign-in to the [Account Portal](https://account.azure.com) as the Subscription Owner.  

**2. Create Locks - Portal** 
  - [Lock the resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-lock-resources) to prevent unexpected changes. 

**3. Create Locks - PowerShell** 
  - [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcelock?view=azurermps-6.1.0&viewFallbackFrom=azurermps-5.1.1#examples)
