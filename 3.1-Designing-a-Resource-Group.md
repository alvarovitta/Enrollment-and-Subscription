# Designing a Resource Group 
Use the procedure described in this section to design a Resource Group. 
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
Use the following information as a guide when designing your Resource Groups:

- The resource group design should follow Agile IT workload designs which include:  Web tier, application 
   tier, data tier, management tier. 
   
- Assign permissions at the resource group level as opposed to assigning them at the subscription level. 
- Use [tagging](4.1-Applying-Azure-Tags.md) within your resource groups to ensure categorization of resources for billing and security purposes. 
- Use a cohesive and consistent naming standard of your security groups across your subscriptions. 
- When creating resource groups, ensure that specific tiers (web, app, data, management) of the workload 
   are assigned to the same region. 
- All the resources in your group should share the same lifecycle. You can deploy, update, and  delete them together. If one resource, such as a database server, needs to exist on a different deployment cycle it should be in another resource group. 
- Resources must belong to a single resource group. 
- A resource group can contain resources that reside in different regions. 
- A resource group is tied to a subscription. A resource group cannot span subscriptions. Once you assign a 
  resource to a resource group, you can move it out, but it can't span multiple subscriptions. 
- A resource can interact with resources in other resource groups. Interaction is common when the two 
  resources are related but do not share the same lifecycle (for example, web apps connecting to a 
  database). 
- A resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative activities. You can apply RBAC 
  permissions at the subscription level or at the resource group level. Anything assigned at the subscription 

level will be inherited at the resource group level. 
- For information on service limitations, see: [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits).  
<br />
<br />

## Preparation 
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:â€¯ 

1. Consult the following stakeholders as part of the subscription definition:

   - **Workload service owners**:  Owner of the business requirements and driver of consumption of the 
   different cloud services. 

   - **Fabric administrator**:  [to be defined, replaced, or removed] 

   - **IT Operations Owners**:  Owner of the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service 
   Management and continuity of operations. 

   - **IT Security and Compliance**:  Owner of the customer policies and procedures related to information 
   classification and handling, security monitoring and controls, and security incident management. 

2. Collect the subscriber details as outlined in the following table:

   | Field | Value |
   |------------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Resource Group Name   | \<Resource Group Name\>   | 
   | Location    | \<Azure Region\> | 
   | Subscription Name  | \<Parent Subscription Name\>  | 
   | Contributor Permission    | \<@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> |  
   | Owner Permission   | \<@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> |  
   | Reader Permission   | \<@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> |  
<br />
<br />

## Procedure:  How to create a Resource Group 
Use this procedure to create a resource group. The Service Administrator uses the [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) or ARM 
templates. 

1. **Define the Resource Group model**

   For recommended patterns, refer to:  
   - [Using the Agile IT Workloads Pattern](3.1.1-Using-the-Agile-IT-Workloads-Pattern.md) 
   - [Using the Traditional IT Workloads Pattern](3.1.2-Using-the-Traditional-IT-Workloads-Pattern.md) 
   - [Using the Access Management Grouping Pattern](3.1.3-Using-the-Access-Management-Grouping-Pattern.md) 

2. **Access the Azure portal**  
   Create and Manage Resource Groups, see: [Manage Azure resources through portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/resourcegroups). 

3. **Create an Azure resource group**  
   Refer to:  [Azure Resource groups using PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermresourcegroup?view=azurermps-6.1.0&viewFallbackFrom=azurermps-5.1.1)  
   Use the command: **New-AzureRmResourceGroup** commandlet 

4. **Create a resource group with tags**  
   
  PS> New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name RG01 -Location "South Central US" -Tag @{Empty=$null; Department="Marketing"}
  This command creates an empty resource group. This command is the same as the command in Example 1, except that it assigns tags to the   resource group. The first tag, named Empty, can be used to identify resource groups that have no resources. The second tag is named Department and has a value of Marketing. You can use a tag such as this one to categorize resource groups for administration or budgeting.

## Next steps 
Understand naming conventions, see: [Applying Naming Standards and Tags](4.0-Applying-Naming-Standards-and-Tags.md)
