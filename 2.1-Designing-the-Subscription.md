# Designing the Subscription 

Use the procedure described in this section as the basis on which to design a subscription. For more information on design considerations and proven practices, see Additional information in this section.  

When designing the subscription model, consider that your organization's subscription enrollment is likely to expand and grow more 
complex over time. Your subscription enrollment strategy should be scalable and adaptive.   
<br />
<br />
  
## Preparation  
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  

1. Consult the following stakeholders as part of the subscription definition:   

   a. **Service Owners:**  [tbd]

    b. **IT Operations owners:**  Owns the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service Management and continuity of 
operations   

    c. **Workload and Application owners:**  Owns the business requirements and driver of consumption of the different cloud 
services  

2. Collect the subscriber details as outlined in the following table:   

    | Field        | Value           |  
    | ------------- |-------------|
    |Subscription Name | \<Subscription_Name\> |
    |Pattern | [Sandbox](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.1-Using-the-Sandbox-Pattern.md), [Production](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.2-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-Pattern.md), [Purpose Built](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.3-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-and-Purpose-Built-Pattern.md) |
    |Account | \<Parent_Account\> |
    |Department | \<Parent_Department\> |
    |Service Administrator Azure AD Credentials | \<service.admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> |
    |Service Administrator Email |\<___@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> |
    |Subscription Type |\<Microsoft Azure Enterprise, Dev/Test\> *|
 
   \*Enterprises can identify an account and a subscription to host DevTest Workloads at a discounted rate. 
<br />
<br />

## Procedure: How to design a subscription  
Use this procedure to design a subscription.  

1. Define the subscription structure. 
  Refer to the following subscription patterns:   

   - [Using the Sandbox Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.1-Using-the-Sandbox-Pattern.md)  

   - [Using the Sandbox + Production Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.2-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-Pattern.md)   

   - [Using the Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.3-Using-the-Sandbox-and-Production-and-Purpose-Built-Pattern.md)  

   - [Using the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/2.1.4-Using-the-Continuous-Development-Lifecycle-Pattern.md)  

   See Subscription Setup Methodology, see: [Onboarding Guide to the Microsoft Azure Enterprise Portal](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/_images/azuredirecteacustomeronboardingguide_en.pdf), pg. 23. 


2. Leverage Dev/Test subscriptions   
  Refer to: [Video: Enabling EA DevTest Subscriptions in the EA Portal](https://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/EA.Azure.com/Enabling-and-Creating-EA-DevTest-Subscriptions-through-the-EA-Portal)  

3. Create the subscription and assign a Service Administrator  
  Access the [Account Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?v=18.20) and follow the steps described in: [Assigning the Service Administrator Role](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/1.4-Assigning-the-Service-Administrator-Role.md). 

4. Designate an RBAC Owner   
  Add an RBAC Owner administrator for a subscription in Azure portal, see: [Manage Administrator Roles - Add an RBAC Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-an-rbac-owner-admin-for-a-subscription-in-azure-portal)  

5. Add or change a Co-administrator   
Using the Azure portal, designate a co-administrator, see:  [Manage Administrator Roles - Add or Change Co-Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-or-change-co-administrator)  

6. Change the Service Administrator for an Azure subscription   
  See: [Manage Administrator Roles - Change the Service Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#change-the-service-administrator-for-an-azure-subscription)  

7. Change the Account Administrator for an Azure subscription   
  See: [Manage Administrator Roles - Change the Account Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#change-the-service-administrator-for-an-azure-subscription).
<br />
<br />

## Next steps 
After you have built a subscription, see: [Defining Resource Groups](3.0-Defining-Resource-Groups.md). 
<br />
<br />

## Additional information  
Use the following supplemental information as required:  

Review the following:  
[Azure enterprise scaffold - prescriptive subscription governance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption-guide/subscription-governance)   

Take subscription limits under consideration when planning for subscription designs.  
See subscription limits at: [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints]() **No valid link available**
<br />
<br />

**Design considerations:**  
When planning to have multiple Azure subscriptions, consider the following implications:  
- Duplicate provisioning and management: IP Address space, network circuits, gateways, vNets, Subnets, NSGs, routing  
- More connectivity to manage   
- More security to manage  
- More identities to manage  
- Potentially more ExpressRoute (ER) circuits to buy  
<br />

**Proven practices:**   
Use the following to assist you when designing your description:
- Plan for multiple subscriptions  
- Start with one subscription; try to minimize the number of subscriptions; add additional subscriptions based on requirements  
- Minimize the number of subscription owners  
- Refrain from assigning one account owner across multiple subscription types  
- Use Azure Active Directory for Azure Governance roles  
- Use Built-In Roles before Custom Roles  
- Create Custom RBAC Roles only if Built-in does not exist  
- Use groups to assign RBAC versus users  
- Take network requirements and Express Route boundaries into account
