# Designing the Subscription 


Use the procedure in this section as the basis on which to design a subscription. For more information on design considerations and 
proven practices, see Additional information in this section.  

  
When designing the subscription model, consider that your organization's subscription enrollment is likely to expand and grow more 
complex over time. Your subscription enrollment strategy should be scalable and adaptive.   

  
  
  
Preparation  

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  

  

Consult the following stakeholders as part of the subscription definition:  

  

Service Owners:  

  


IT Operations owners:  Owns the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service Management and continuity of 
operations  

  


Workload and Application owners: Owns the business requirements and driver of consumption of the different cloud 
services  

  



Collect the subscriber details as outlined in the following table:  



 







Field 
 


Value 
 



Subscription Name 
 


<Subscription Name> 
 



Pattern 
 


Sandbox, Production, Purpose Built 
 



Account 
 


<Parent Accoun> 
 



Department 
 


<Parent Department> 
 



Service Administrator Azure AD Credentials 
 


<service.admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com> 
 



Service Administrator Email 
 


<___@tenant.onmicrosoft.com> 
 



Subscription Type 
 


Microsoft Azure Enterprise, Dev/Test* 
 


*Enterprises can identify an account and a subscription to host DevTest Workloads at a discounted rate. 


 


 


 


Procedure: How to design a subscription  


  


Use this procedure to design a subscription.  


  

Define the subscription structure  



Refer to the following subscription patterns:   

Using the Sandbox Pattern  


Using the Sandbox + Production Pattern   


Using the Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern  


Using the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern  



 See Subscription Setup Methodology, page 23:   Onboarding Guide to the Microsoft Azure Enterprise Portal 


 

Leverage Dev/Test subscriptions  



Refer to:  Video: Enabling EA DevTest Subscriptions in the EA Portal  


  

Create the subscription and assign a Service Administrator 



Access the Account Portal and follow the steps described in: Assigning the Service Administrator Role. 


 

Designate an RBAC Owner  



Add an RBAC Owner administrator for a subscription in Azure portal, see:  Manage Administrator Roles - Add an RBAC Owner  


  

Add or change a Co-administrator  



Using the Azure portal, designate a co-administrator, see:  Manage Administrator Roles - Add or Change Co-Administrator  


  

Change the Service Administrator for an Azure subscription  



See:  Manage Administrator Roles - Change the Service Administrator  


  

Change the Account Administrator for an Azure subscription  



See:  Manage Administrator Roles - Change the Account Administrator  


  


 


 


Next Steps 


After you have built a subscription, see:  Defining Resource Groups. 


 


 


 


Additional information  


Use the following supplemental information as required:  


 


Review the following: Azure enterprise scaffold - prescriptive subscription governance   


 


Take subscription limits under consideration when planning for subscription designs. See subscription limits at: Azure subscription and 
service limits, quotas, and constraints  


 


Design considerations: 


When planning to have multiple Azure subscriptions, consider the complexity implications including:  


 

Duplicate provisioning and management: IP Address space, network circuits, gateways, vNets, Subnets, NSGs, routing  



 

More connectivity to manage   



 

More security to manage  



 

More identities to manage  



 

Potentially more ExpressRoute (ER) circuits to buy  

  



 


Proven practices:  

Plan for multiple subscriptions  



 

Start with one subscription; try to minimize the number of subscriptions; add additional subscriptions based on requirements  



 

Minimize the number of subscription owners  



 

Refrain from assigning one account owner across multiple subscription types  



 

Use Azure Active Directory for Azure Governance roles  



 

Use Built-In Roles before Custom Roles  



 

Create Custom RBAC Roles only if Built-in does not exist  



 

Use groups to assign RBAC versus users  



 

Take network requirements and Express Route boundaries into account
