# Defining Subscriptions and Patterns 


A subscription is a logical limit of scale by which resources can be allocated. These limits include hard and soft caps of various resource types (for example, 10,000 compute cores per region per subscription in the Azure Resource Manager model). A subscription 
additionally forms a top-level billing unit.

**Subscription and account management**  
The figure below shows the hierarchy and management structure for each subscription.  
Subscriptions are managed as follows:  
- The Account Owner manages each account and associated subscription through the Account Portal. 
- An account can have one or more associated subscription.   
- Only the Account Owner has the ability to create subscriptions.   
- Creating different subscriptions and assigning a different Service Administrator and Co-Administrators to each subscription 
provides controlled access to development projects and environments within the organization.

**Subscription patterns**   
A pattern is a subscription design template that is based on the needs of the organization. This guide describes the following pattern 
scenarios: 
- **Sandbox Pattern:** Use when learning how to use Azure and build subscriptions.    
- **Sandbox +  Production:** Use to create a separate subscription to deploy production workloads.  
- **Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built:**  Use for organizations that require a separate, production-ready subscription for running 
workloads.  
- **Continuous Development Lifecycle:** Use to maintain isolated sandbox subscription and production workloads.
