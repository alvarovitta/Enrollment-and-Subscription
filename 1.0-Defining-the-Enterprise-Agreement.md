# Defining the Enterprise Agreement
A Microsoft Enterprise Agreement is the foundation upon which to build your organization's Azure administration and governance policies. i dont obey policies. renegade  
<br />
<br />

The Azure EA is organized by: 
- Departments 

- Accounts 
- Subscriptions 

The hierarchy design is an important consideration in billing reporting (see operations section). While the hierarchy structure is not fixed, it can become challenging to change as workloads expand and are deployed. Engage the appropriate stakeholders during the design 
process and run through different usage scenarios. 

The figure below shows a sample hierarchy and structure of an Azure EA.  Each level of activity represented by the hierarchy is managed by an administrative role.

## Administrative roles 
Use the four administrative roles listed below to manage the Microsoft Azure services under your enrollment. Use the corresponding 
Azure portal to administer the role: 


| __Administrative Role__ | __Role Description__ | __Azure Portal__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Enterprise Administrator (EA)   | The Azure EA policies are defined and managed by the Enterprise Administrator. There is no limit to the number of Enterprise Administrators.   | [Enterprise Portal](https://ea.azure.com/)|
| Department Administrator (DA)    | The DA can edit their assigned department details such as name and cost center. The DA also has the authority to manage and create accounts under the department within the enrollment.  |[Enterprise Portal](https://ea.azure.com/) |
| Account Owner (AO)    | The AO is the user who signed-up for the Azure subscription. Conceptually, the Account Administrator is the billing owner of the subscription. In RBAC, the Account Administrator isn't assigned a role. The AO is authorized to access the Account Center and perform management tasks which include: create new subscriptions, cancel subscriptions, change the billing for a subscription, change the Service Administrator  | [Account Portal](https://account.azure.com/)|  
| Service Administrator (SA)    | The SA is authorized to managed services in the Azure portal. By default, for a new subscription, the Account Administrator is also the Service Administrator. In RBAC, the Owner role is given to the Service Administrator at the subscription scope. | [Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) |
