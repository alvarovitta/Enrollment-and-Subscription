associate a new Account Owner by entering a new, valid email address.

## Additional information  


Use the following supplemental information for this procedure:  

**Important:**   </br>
*- bThe association of an account and its subscriptions occurs on the day the Account Owner signs into the enterprise portal; the account  owner email address is confirmed. Existing subscriptions transferred to an Enterprise Enrollment are immediately transitioned to  billing on the Enterprise Enrollment. The Account owner is responsible for paying any outstanding charges on the payment 
instrument prior to the association date.*
</br>
- *Billing for usage on transferred accounts is based on the terms of the Enterprise Enrollment. For account subscriptions with special pricing (including no charge services), once transferred, the account starts to incur costs based on the terms of the Azure Amendment to the Enterprise Enrollment.*   
</br>
- *Subscriptions formerly using a different offer type for payment such as: Pay As You Go on a credit card is converted to Enterprise Offers. To confirm the transition has occurred, the automated process renames the subscription and appends: "converted to EA" to the subscription name.*

**Note 1:** *The Account Owner will not have visibility of the monetary commitment balance unless they also have Enterprise 
Administrator rights.*  
 


**Note 2:** *Account Owners must not use the same login credentials used for the Enterprise Agreement (EA) on other Azure offers. 
Doing so will convert the other Azure subscriptions (e.g., Visual Studio subscription Benefits, BizSpark, MPN, Pay-As-You-Go, etc.) into 
the EA.  To recover from this situation, delete either the AO from the EA portal and re-subscribe to the various offers or, delete the 
subscriber from the offer and re-assign the subscription using different login credentials.*  


*If for example, the same login for the EA is used for Visual Studio subscription, recover your individual Visual Studio Azure Benefit 
using either of the following:*  
 
   - Delete the Account Owner from the EA Portal (after removing or moving any Azure subscriptions they own). The AO must then 
   sign up for their individual Visual Studio Azure benefits anew.  


   - Delete the subscriber from the Visual Studio Administration site in the VLSC and reassign the subscription. The subscriber must 
   use a different login, then sign up for a new individual Visual Studio Azure benefit offer.
