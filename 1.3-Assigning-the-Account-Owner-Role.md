Use the procedure described in this section to assign Account Owner (AO) roles to each department. Account Owners administer 
department subscriptions. For more information on AO responsibilities, see Additional information in this section.   
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  

1. Consult the following stakeholders as part of the Account Owner definition:  

   a.  **Department owners**:  Responsible and accountable for the consumption of Azure services and related expenses  


   b.  **Workload service owners**: Owns the business requirements and drivers consumption of the different cloud services  


   c.  **IT Operations owners**:  Owns the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service Management and continuity of 
   operations.  


   d.  **IT Security and Compliance**:  Owns the customer policies and procedures related to Privileged Access Management and 
   Identity and, Access Management policies applicable to the creation and management of Azure administration credentials.  


 2. Collect the AO and department details as outlined in the following table:  

    | Field | Value |
    |------------------------------|----------------------------|
    | Account Owner Name   | \<Account Name\>   | 
    | Department   | \<Parent_Department\> | 
    | Cost Center  | \<Cost_Center\>  | 
    | Account Owner Azure AD Credentials    | \<account.admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\> | 
    | Account Owner Email | \<account.admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com\>  | 
    | Is there an existing Account Owner   | \<Yes\> or \<No\> | 
<br />
<br />

## Procedure: How to assign the Account Owner role  
Use this procedure to create and validate ownership of an Account Owner role.    

1. **Sign into the Azure account portal**  
    Sign-in to the Account Portal using the account specified by the Enterprise Administrator, see:  https://account.windowsazure.com.  

2. **Associate an Account Owner with an email address**  
    Associate the account with an existing, valid Account Owner. Enter the email address associated with the account. Alternatively, 
associate a new Account Owner by entering a new, valid email address.  

3. **Confirm account ownership**  
    Confirm the account ownership was created. The owner of the email address provided in the previous step receives a notification 
that they have been invited to activate their account in the enrollment.  For more information on email notifications, see Additional 
Information in this section.  

4. **Activate account ownership**  
    Activate the account ownership by signing in to the Enterprise Portal with the Account Owner email address provided.   
    
    Receipt of email notification is not required for login. Valid Account Owners can log into the Azure Enterprise Administrator Portal: 
https://ea.azure.com.  
<br />
<br />


### Additional information  
Use the following supplemental information for this procedure:  

**Important:**
- The association of an account and its subscriptions occurs on the day the Account Owner signs into the enterprise portal. The Account 
Owner email address is confirmed. Existing subscriptions transferred to an Enterprise Enrollment are immediately transitioned to 
billing on the Enterprise Enrollment. The Account owner is responsible for paying any outstanding charges on the payment 
instrument prior to the association date.   

- Billing for usage on transferred accounts is based on the terms of the Enterprise Enrollment. For account subscriptions with special 
pricing (including no charge services), once transferred, the account starts to incur costs based on the terms of the Azure 
Amendment to the Enterprise Enrollment.   
  
- Subscriptions formerly using a different offer type for payment such as: Pay As You Go on a credit card is converted to Enterprise 
Offers. To confirm the transition has occurred, the automated process renames the subscription and appends: "converted to EA" to 
the subscription name.

- The Account Owner role is delegated by the Department Administrator and has the following responsibilities:

  **Note 1:** The Account Owner will not have visibility of the monetary commitment balance unless they also have Enterprise 
Administrator rights. 


  **Note 2:** Account Owners must not use the same login credentials used for the Enterprise Agreement (EA) on other Azure offers. 
Doing so will convert the other Azure subscriptions (e.g., Visual Studio subscription Benefits, BizSpark, MPN, Pay-As-You-Go, etc.) into the EA.  To recover from this situation, delete either the AO from the EA portal and re-subscribe to the various offers or, delete the 
subscriber from the offer and re-assign the subscription using different login credentials.  

  If for example, the same login for the EA is used for Visual Studio subscription, recover your individual Visual Studio Azure Benefit 
using either of the following:  
 
   - Delete the Account Owner from the EA Portal (after removing or moving any Azure subscriptions they own). The AO must then 
   sign up for their individual Visual Studio Azure benefits anew.  


   - Delete the subscriber from the Visual Studio Administration site in the VLSC and reassign the subscription. The subscriber must 
   use a different login, then sign up for a new individual Visual Studio Azure benefit offer.   
<br />
