# Using the Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern 


Use the Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern for organizations that require a separate, production-ready subscription for 
running workloads.  


 


The defined governance and controls for standard sandbox and production workloads do not apply, for example: a research project that 
is managed by a separate entity, or for different regulation requirements, or where controls are applied differently. 


 


The Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern has the following properties: 

a separate production environment (purpose-built) that is separate from the main production environment 



 

each environment contains different types of applications (sandbox/non-prod, production, and purpose-built) 



 

environments are isolated from each other 



 

virtual networks will wrap the different applications for traffic separation 



 

each subscription trusts a single Azure AD tenant 



 

each subscription contains a separate Azure AD account owner (see Service Administrators section) 



 


 


The following table provides a profile description for the personas who use this pattern:   


 







IT Operations 
 


Security/Compliance Officer 
 


Finance/Business 
 


Research Scientist 
 



Need: a production-ready environment that leverages newest Azure Emerging functionality in regions not supported in my corporate environment." 
 


Need: production environment with segregated access to abide by specific compliance regulations and to enforce more strict security controls than my regular corporate environment 
 


Need: to fund and track budget allocation which differs from corporate environment 
 


Collaborate with external organizations, leverage external data sources and networks, provision and run scientific workloads.
