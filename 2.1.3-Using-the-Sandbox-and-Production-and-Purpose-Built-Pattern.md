# Using the Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern 
Use the Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern for organizations that require a separate, production-ready subscription for 
running workloads.  
<br />
<br />

The defined governance and controls for standard sandbox and production workloads do not apply; for example: a research project that 
is managed by a separate entity, or for different regulation requirements, or where controls are applied differently. 
<br />
<br />

The Sandbox + Production + Purpose Built Pattern has the following properties: 
- A separate production environment (purpose-built) that is separate from the main production environment

- Each environment contains different types of applications (sandbox/non-prod, production, and purpose-built) 
- Environments are isolated from each other 
- Virtual networks will wrap the different applications for traffic separation 
- Each subscription trusts a single Azure AD tenant 
- Each subscription contains a separate Azure AD account owner (see Service Administrators section) 
<br />
<br />

The following table provides a profile description for the personas who use this pattern:   

| Persona | Requirements|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| IT Operations | Need a production-ready environment that leverages newest Azure Emerging functionality in regions not supported in my corporate environment.|
| Security/Compliance Officer | Need a production environment with segregated access to abide by specific compliance regulations and to enforce more strict security controls than my regular corporate environment |
| Finance/Business | Need to fund and track budget allocation which differs from corporate environment |
| Research Scientist | Need to collaborate with external organizations, leverage external data sources and networks, provision and run scientific workloads. |
<br />
<br />

## Additional information  
Consider the following supplemental information for this pattern:   
  
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Vnet address spaces can be tailored per application | Multiple environments to manage |
| Environment Isolation  | Granulated Application RBAC model for Azure |
| Lower cost on Dev Test Subscriptions | Double Azure AD RBAC and Operations effort |
| | Additional complexity with multiple AADs |
| | Requires medium capacity planning |
