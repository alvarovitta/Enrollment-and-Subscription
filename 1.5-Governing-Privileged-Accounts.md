# Governing Privileged Accounts 

Use the procedure described in this section to assign a Privileged Account status and activate appropriate protections. For more information on design considerations and proven practices, see Additional information in this section.  
<br />
<br />

Privileged Accounts are those accounts in the enterprise or azure portal that have greater permission levels than regular user accounts. These types of accounts have a high risk surface attack area and as a result, must be afforded appropriate levels of protection.  
<br />
<br />

## Guidance   
Use the following as guidelines when applying governance to Privileged Accounts:  

  - Don’t use generic accounts because there is no accountability or traceability to person and it can be shared 
  
  - Create separate accounts for Privileged role members and name them accordingly (e.g. GA-Admin-JSmith for Global Admins)  
  - Have a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 subscription owners (service admins and co-admins) to prevent collusion while preventing admin 
  sprawl  
  - Ensure the admin accounts you select are managed accounts. i.e. Corporate accounts that are within your Azure AD Tenant or Synced from On-premise AD.  
  - Make certain Admin Accounts can only be accessed via an enforceable, automated workflow approval process which requires an approver who 
  is different from the requestor.  
  - Ensure privileged role assignment is not assigned permanently but on a just in time basis  
  - Enforce Multi-Factor authentication and risk-based conditional access on admin accounts.  
  - Implement Azure AD [PIM (Privileged Identity Management)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure) across Admin Accounts and privileged azure roles to enforce just-in-time 
  administration  
  - Implement a periodic (quarterly) Admin Account access review to re-certify who should continue to have access to admin and should be different from the Role Owner  
  - Monitor via real-time alerts when members are added or removed from privilege roles   
  - Enable > Medium Risk Conditional Policy rule using Azure AD [Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-enable)  to protect Admin Accounts (based on privileged account members belonging to an Azure AD Group)  
  - Configure [Conditional Access Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access-locations) to ensure privileged accounts can only logging from trusted networks  
  - Use a [Hardened Admin Workstation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-management#client-configuration) when logging on with privileged accounts to Azure  
- For further information on Privileged Accounts, see:  [What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure)  
- Azure AD [PIM (Privileged Identity Management)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure) requires Azure AD [premium P2](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) licenses or [EMS (Enterprise Mobility Suite) E5 licenses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security-pricing)   
- Azure AD [Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-enable) requires Azure AD [premium P2](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) licenses or [EMS (Enterprise Mobility Suite) E5 licenses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security-pricing)     
<br />
<br />

## Preparation  
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:  

Consult the following stakeholders as part of the subscription definition:  

- **Enterprise administrators**: Responsible for the management of the most privileged Azure tenant account   
  
- **Department owners**:  Responsible and accountable for the consumption of Azure services and related expenses   
  
- **Workload service owners**: Owns the business requirements and driver of consumption of the different cloud services   
  
- **Fabric administrator**:  [to be defined, replaced, or removed]   
  
- **IT Operations owners**:  Owns the customer policies and procedures related to IT Service Management and continuity of operations.   
  
 - **IT Security and compliance**:  Owns the customer policies and procedures related to Privileged Access Management and Identity and, Access Management policies applicable to the creation and management of Azure administration credentials  
<br />
<br />

## Procedure: How to assign a Privileged Account identity  
Use this procedure to implement Azure AD PIM and Azure AD Identity Protection. Refer to **Government of Canada Privileged Accounts Guidance for recommended patterns** [LINK BROKEN, UNABLE TO FIND ONENOTE URL FOR THIS LINK].  

1. **Open the Account Portal**  
   Sign-in to the [Account Portal]((https://account.azure.com)) using the email specified by the Enterprise Administrator.  

2. **Add the Privileged Identity management application**  
   Use the instructions described in:  [Start using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-getting-started).  

3. **Activate Azure Active Directory identity protection**   
   Use the instructions described in: [Steps to enable Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-enable).
