# Applying Naming Standards and Tags 
This section provides common practices to use when designing naming standards and tags in Azure.

Apply tags to Azure resources to logically organize them by categories. Each tag consists of a name and a value. Define names and 
values that make the most sense for organizing your subscription.  


**Example:**  
You can apply the name: "Environment" and the value: "Production" to all the resources in production. Without this tag, 
you may have difficulty identifying if a resource is intended for development, test, or production.

## Guidance
Use the following information to help when deciding on how to name your tags.

**Naming conventions**:   

The choice of a name for any resource in Microsoft Azure is important because:â€¯ 

  - Follow [Azure naming rules and restrictions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions#naming-rules-and-restrictions) as it is difficult to change a name later 
  - Names must meet the requirements of their specific resource type 
  - Some types of resources require additional care for [naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions#naming-rules-and-restrictions) 
      - When naming Azure subscriptions, verbose names make understanding the context and purpose of each subscription clear. 
  When working in an environment with many subscriptions, following a shared naming convention can improve clarity. 
      - Recommended pattern for naming subscriptions: Company, Department (optional), Product Line or Service (optional), Environment
      
 **Example subscription naming approach:** 

   | __Department__ | __Product Line or Service__ | __Environment__ | __Full Name__ |
   |------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
   | Marketing   | Social Analytics Service   |  Production   |  Corp Marketing Social Analytics Service Production  | 
 

### Tags:  

The following limitations apply to tags: 

   - Each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 15 tag name/value pairs. This limitation applies only to tags directly 
   applied to the resource group or resource. A resource group can contain many resources that each have 15 tag name/value 
   pairs. 

   - If you have more than 15 values that you need to associate with a resource, use a JSON string for the tag value. The JSON string 
   can contain many tag values. 

   - The tag name is limited to 512 characters, and the tag value is limited to 256 characters. For storage accounts, the tag name is 
   limited to 128 characters, and the tag value is limited to 256 characters. 

   - Tags applied to the resource group are not inherited by the resources in that resource group. 

   - Use Azure resource policies to apply and enforce mandatory tags across your subscriptions and resource groups to avoid 
   deployment of resources without the required tags 

   - Leverage Tags for purposes of billing monitoring and reporting 

   - Leverage Tags for security and inventory of resources
