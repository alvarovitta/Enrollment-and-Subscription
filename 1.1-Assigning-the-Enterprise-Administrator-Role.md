<br />
<br />

## Additional information 
Use the following supplemental information as required:  

A dual EA role assignment offers the following protections:  
  
  - **Segregation of Duties (SoD):**  
   SoD is a basic internal control intended to ensure that no single individual has the authority to execute two or more conflicting, sensitive transactions. The purpose of SoD is to prevent or reduce introducing the risk of errors that may affect the infrastructure as a result of changes.    

  - **Staff redundancy:**   
    - Assign both a primary and secondary EA to ensure a point of administrative contact is always available. 
    - If enterprise-wide decisions are required, both primary and secondary EAs must approve.  
 
  - **Prevent collusion:** Due to the shared responsibility of the EA role, no unplanned or unlawful activity can be executed without scrutiny.
