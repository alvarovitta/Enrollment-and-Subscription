Use this guide to set up and configure an Azure Enterprise Account for your organization.  


 


Any Microsoft customer with a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement can add Azure to their Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) by making an 
upfront monetary commitment to Azure. Funds deposited on account are used over the course of the year as Azure services are consumed.  


 


Use the following enrollment sequence when designing an Azure EA service hierarchy. This enrollment approach best represents an 
organizationâ€™s operating model and considers billing, resource access and organizational structure: 


 

Defining the Enterprise Agreement: Define Azure Enterprise Administration (EA) roles 



 

Defining Subscriptions and Patterns:  Define the subscription model, create subscriptions and, assign service administrators 



 

Defining Resource Groups: Organize and group resources logically by similarity, function, geography or by workload 



 

Applying Naming Standards and Tags: Categorize Azure resources for the purpose of security auditing, chargeback, and show-back 



 

Defining Resource Policies and Locks: Specify governance controls that regulate how organizations manage their Azure resources 



 

Using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Specify Azure permissions
