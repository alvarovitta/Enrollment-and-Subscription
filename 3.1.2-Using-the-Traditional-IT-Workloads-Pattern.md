# Using the Traditional IT Workloads Pattern 

Use this pattern to group Traditional IT workloads by the items within the same lifecycle, such as 
an application. Grouping by application allows for individual application management. 

Consider the following supplemental information for this pattern:  


**Advantages:**

  - All resources that support an application are contained within the same resource group. 


**Disadvantages:** 

  - An error in administration could affect all application resources within a resource group 
  - No ability to segregate network traffic between application components 
  - Access granted at the resource group level provides access to all resources within an 
  application
