# Using the Sandbox + Production Pattern 
Use the Sandbox + Production Pattern once you are ready to deploy production workloads in Azure. Use this pattern to create a separate subscription when deploying production workloads. 
<br />
<br />

**Stakeholders**:  
- Service Owners

- IT Operations Owners 
- Security/Compliance Officer 
- Workload & Application Owners 
- Finance 

The following table provides a profile description of those who may use this pattern:  

| Persona | Requirement|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| IT Operations  | Need a production environment that is network isolated from sandbox environment to avoid administration mistakes from affecting production |
| Security/Compliance Officer | Need a separate access control mechanisms to ensure staff with access to sandbox environment don’t also have access to production environment |
| Finance/Business | Need to leverage discounted subscription for sandbox environments |
|Development Manager | Need isolated self-service environment to experiment with azure features/functionality that can be easily be setup and torn down |

For information on Azure limits, see: [Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits).

<br />

The figure below illustrates the Sandbox + Production Pattern. The pattern has the following properties:
- Each environment contains different types of applications (sandbox/non-prod and production) 

- subscriptions are network isolated from one another 
- Virtual networks will wrap the different applications for traffic separation 
- Subscription have different pricing models 
- Both subscriptions trust a single Azure AD tenant 
- Each subscription contains a separate Azure AD account owner (see Service Administrators section)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ------- | ------ |
| vNet address spaces can be tailored per application without risk of network address space conflicts| Multiple environments to manage|
| Environment isolation  | Granulated Application RBAC model |
|Lower cost on DevTest subscriptions  | Requires medium capacity planning  |
