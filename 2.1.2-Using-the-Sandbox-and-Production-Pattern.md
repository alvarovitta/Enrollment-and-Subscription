# Using the Sandbox + Production Pattern 


Use the Sandbox + Production Pattern once you are ready to deploy production workloads in Azure. You can use this pattern where you will create a separate 
subscription when deploying production workloads. 


 


 


 


The Sandbox + Production Pattern has the following properties: 

each environment contains different types of applications (sandbox/non-prod and production) 



 

subscriptions are network isolated from one another 



 

virtual networks will wrap the different applications for traffic separation 



 

subscription have different pricing models 



 

both subscriptions trust 1 single Azure AD tenant 



 

each subscription contains a separate Azure AD account owner (see Service Administrators section) 



 


 


 


Stakeholders: 

Service Owners  


IT Operations Owners 


Security/Compliance Officer 


Workload & Application Owners 


Finance 



 


The following table provides a profile description for the personas who use this pattern:   


 







IT Operations 
 


Security/Compliance Officer 
 


Finance/Business 
 


Development Manager 
 



Need: a production environment that is network isolated from sandbox environment to avoid administration mistakes from affecting production. 
 


Need: a separate access control mechanisms to ensure staff with access to sandbox environment don’t also have access to production environment 
 


Need: to leverage discounted subscription for sandbox environments 
 


Need: isolated self-service environment to experiment with azure features/functionality that can be easily be setup and torn down

For more information on Azure limits, see: Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints 


 


Advantages:  

vNet address spaces can be tailored per application without risk of network address space conflicts  


Environment isolation  


Lower cost on DevTest subscriptions  



  


Disadvantages:  

Multiple environment to manage 


Granulated Application RBAC model  


Requires medium capacity planning
