# Defining Resource Groups 
Use the procedures and information in this section to design a Resource Group. 
<br />
<br />

A Resource Group is a logical container in which you can pool and categorize your resources. Resource groups are also used to 
manage access control. 

- For information on Resource Groups, see: [Resoure Group Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups). 
- For information on how to access and manage Resoure Groups, see: [Resource Group Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal).
<br />

Resource Group examples:  
- Billing 
- Security 
- Web servers 
- Compute resources 
- Applications 
<br />
<br />

Use one of the following Resource Group patterns to define your Resource Group:
- [Agile IT Workloads Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/3.1.1-Using-the-Agile-IT-Workloads-Pattern.md)

- [Traditional IT Workloads Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/3.1.2-Using-the-Traditional-IT-Workloads-Pattern.md)

- [Access Management Grouping Pattern](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Enrollment-and-Subscription/blob/master/3.1.3-Using-the-Access-Management-Grouping-Pattern.md)
<br />
<br />

The following figure illustrates the association between the Subscription Administrator and subscription.
