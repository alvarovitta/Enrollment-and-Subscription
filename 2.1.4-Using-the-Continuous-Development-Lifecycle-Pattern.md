# Using the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern 
Use the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern to maintain isolated sandbox subscription and production workloads. Subscriptions can be used for the purposes of code promotion approaches. 
<br />
<br />

The following table provides a profile description of those who use this pattern:   

| Persona | Requirements |
| --------- | ---------- |
| IT Operations | Need to connect DevOps environment to production to facilitate code promotion between environments, plus a sandbox environment that is network isolated from production environment to avoid administration mistakes from affecting production |
| Security/Compliance Officer | Need to separate access control definitions to ensure staff with access to sandbox environment don’t also have access to production environment. Connections and network traffic between DEV and PROD subscriptions should be managed |
| Finance/Business | Need to leverage discounted subscription for sandbox and dev environments |
| Development Manager | Need to isolate self-service environment to experiment with azure features/functionality that can be easily be setup and torn down |
<br />
<br />

The figure below illustrates the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern. The pattern has the following properties: 
- Each environment contains the different types of applications.  

- Virtual Networks will wrap the different applications for traffic separation.  
- Subnets will be created within each environment to establish required security isolation zones among application tiers.  
- Each subscriptions trust 1 single Azure AD tenant. 
- Each subscription contains a separate Azure AD account owner (see Service Administrators section). 
- Dev subscription contains separate subnets and resource groups that isolate (Test, Dev and QA environments).

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ----------- |
|Streamlined Continuous code deployment | Multiple environments to manage |
| | Granulated Application RBAC model |
| | Requires medium capacity planning |
| | Complex Vnet addressing |
| | Mistake in management could affect all environments |
