# Using the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern 


Use the Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern to maintain isolated sandbox subscription and production workloads. Subscriptions can be used for 
the purposes of code promotion approaches. 


 


The Continuous Development Lifecycle Pattern has the following properties: 

Each environment contains the different types of applications.  



 

Virtual Networks will wrap the different applications for traffic separation.  



 

Subnets will be created within each environment to establish required security isolation zones among application tiers.  



 

Each subscriptions trust 1 single Azure AD tenant. 



 

Each subscription contains a separate Azure AD account owner (see Service Administrators section). 



 

Dev subscription contains separate subnets and resource groups that isolate (Test, Dev and QA environments). 



 


 


The following table provides a profile description for the personas who use this pattern:   


 







IT Operations 
 


Security/Compliance Officer 
 


Finance/Business 
 


Development Manager 
 



Need: to connect DevOps environment to production to facilitate code promotion between environments, plus a sandbox environment that is network isolated from production environment to avoid administration mistakes from affecting production 
 


Need: separate access control definitions to ensure staff with access to sandbox environment don’t also have access to production environment. 


Connections and network traffic between DEV and PROD subscriptions should be managed 
 


Need: to leverage discounted subscription for sandbox and dev environments 
 


Need: isolated self-service environment to experiment with azure features/functionality that can be easily be setup and torn down 
 


 


 


 


Additional Information 


Consider the following supplemental information for this pattern:  


 


Advantages:  


Streamlined Continuous code deployment 


 


Disadvantages: 

Multiple environments to manage 


Granulated Application RBAC model 


Requires medium capacity planning 


Complex Vnet addressing 


Mistake in management could affect all environments
