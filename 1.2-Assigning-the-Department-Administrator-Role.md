# Assigning the Department Administrator Role

Use the procedure described in this section to define Department Administrator (DA) roles and account structures. For more 
information on DA responsibilities, see Additional information below.   

Organizations may want to split administration and costs by business units or other logical divisions. Azure refers to these 
divisions as: Departments. An Enterprise enrollment can have many departments. Each department is assigned two Department 
Administrators.
